iThemes-Curriculum 
==================

The iThemes Curriculum Guide is organized as a series of twenty topical lessons which can be modified for a 15 week university course curriculum, a K-12 course setting, or other training environments. Each lesson includes objectives, lecture teaching points, assigned readings, tutorial videos, hands-on practice activities, and additional resources. Several options for student web design projects and evaluation rubrics are also included. Many hands-on activities for students involve writing a blog post and following accompanying rubric.  We recommend you setup a class WordPress blog which students can use to post and share reflection assignments.

The 20 sessions presented in this guide are organized into 6 modules:

1. Web Fundamentals

3. Media
